/**
 * <p>This class provides a container DD instance that allows dropping on multiple child target nodes.</p>
 * <p>By default, this class requires that child nodes accepting drop are registered with <b class='link'>Ext.dd.Registry</b>.
 * However a simpler way to allow a DropZone to manage any number of target elements is to configure the
 * DropZone with an implementation of <b class='link' title='#getTargetFromEvent'>getTargetFromEvent</b> which interrogates the passed
 * mouse event to see if it has taken place within an element, or class of elements. This is easily done
 * by using the event's <b class='link' title='ext.EventObjectClass#getTarget'>getTarget</b> method to identify a node based on a
 * <b class='link'>ext.DomQuery</b> selector.</p>
 * <p>Once the DropZone has detected through calling getTargetFromEvent, that the mouse is over
 * a drop target, that target is passed as the first parameter to <b class='link' title='#onNodeEnter'>onNodeEnter</b>, <b class='link' title='#onNodeOver'>onNodeOver</b>,
 * <b class='link' title='#onNodeOut'>onNodeOut</b>, <b class='link' title='#onNodeDrop'>onNodeDrop</b>. You may configure the instance of DropZone with implementations
 * of these methods to provide application-specific behaviour for these events to update both
 * application state, and UI state.</p>
 * <p>For example to make a GridPanel a cooperating target with the example illustrated in
 * <b class='link' title='Ext.dd.DragZone'>DragZone</b>, the following technique might be used:</p><pre><code>
myGridPanel.on('render', function() {
    myGridPanel.dropZone = new Ext.dd.DropZone(myGridPanel.getView().scroller, {

&#47;/      If the mouse is over a grid row, return that node. This is
&#47;/      provided as the "target" parameter in all "onNodeXXXX" node event handling functions
        getTargetFromEvent&#58; function(e) {
            return e.getTarget(myGridPanel.getView().rowSelector);
        },

&#47;/      On entry into a target node, highlight that node.
        onNodeEnter : function(target, dd, e, data){ 
            Ext.fly(target).addClass('my-row-highlight-class');
        },

&#47;/      On exit from a target node, unhighlight that node.
        onNodeOut : function(target, dd, e, data){ 
            Ext.fly(target).removeClass('my-row-highlight-class');
        },

&#47;/      While over a target node, return the default drop allowed class which
&#47;/      places a "tick" icon into the drag proxy.
        onNodeOver : function(target, dd, e, data){ 
            return Ext.dd.DropZone.prototype.dropAllowed;
        },

&#47;/      On node drop we can interrogate the target to find the underlying
&#47;/      application object that is the real target of the dragged data.
&#47;/      In this case, it is a Record in the GridPanel's Store.
&#47;/      We can use the data set up by the DragZone's getDragData method to read
&#47;/      any data we decided to attach in the DragZone's getDragData method.
        onNodeDrop : function(target, dd, e, data){
            var rowIndex = myGridPanel.getView().findRowIndex(target);
            var r = myGridPanel.getStore().getAt(rowIndex);
            ext.Msg.alert('Drop gesture', 'Dropped Record id ' + data.draggedRecord.id +
                ' on Record id ' + r.id);
            return true;
        }
    });
}
