/**
 * Interactions are very simple objects that represent an action performed by specific <a href="Ext.Controller.html">Ext.Controller</a> action. The must consist of the <a href="output/Ext.Interaction.html#Ext.Interaction-controller">controller</a> and <a href="output/Ext.Interaction.html#Ext.Interaction-action">action</a> to be called, but can contain any other data too. See <a href="Ext.Dispatcher.html">Ext.Dispatcher</a> for more details on how Interactions fit into the application ecosystem.
 <p>Interactions are an internal representation that most developers will not have much direct use for. They help provide a normalized API for controller actions - each action should simply be set up to receive an Interaction object. Because Interaction objects are always created when dispatching to a controller action, it is possible to store the Interaction objects that were created in a session to perform simple analytics on how the application is used. This is not built into the framework at the moment, but is left open for custom development if needed.</p>
